Analysis: 
Based on our data, we can see that the amount of male and female mice are almost the same, when we remove the duplicate mouse. 

Based on our analyzed and fixed data, we can note that there is a larger amount of mice that were treated with capomulin and ramicane. We can also see that Infubinol was the only drug seen that has an outlier according to the box plot. On the line chart for mouse 1509, we can see that the longer time they spent on Capomulin, the volume of the tumor size decreased per a span of 40 days. Lastly, we can see that there is a positive correlation between the average tumor volume and the weight, which could mean that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes.
